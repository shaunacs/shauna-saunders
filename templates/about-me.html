                    Hi, I'm Shauna! I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for turning ideas into reality through code.
                </p>

                <p class="about-paragraph">
                    My journey into development started long before I wrote my first line of code. As a kid, I was the one taking toys apart just to see how they worked. That curiosity has been with me my whole life, even when others didn't see my potential. Growing up, I learned early on that I'd have to prove myself and fight for opportunities that others took for granted—a lesson that's shaped my entire path.
                </p>

                <p class="about-paragraph">
                    I didn't study computer science in college. Honestly, I didn't even know it was an option when I started at UNC-Chapel Hill with a focus on Human Development & Family Studies. But when I discovered software engineering, everything clicked. I made the leap, completed an intensive bootcamp at Hackbright Academy, and never looked back. My nontraditional background isn't a limitation—it's my strength. It taught me grit, determination, and how to learn anything I set my mind to.
                </p>

                <p class="about-paragraph">
                    What I enjoy most about development is the collaborative process of bringing someone's vision to life. Whether it's creating a web portal that streamlines operations for a local food pantry (my first project!) or building custom websites that help businesses establish their online presence, I thrive on understanding what people need and crafting something that works beautifully for them.
                </p>

                <p class="about-paragraph">
                    My background spans full-stack development with Python, JavaScript, React, and more, plus experience in quality assurance that gives me a keen eye for detail and user experience. I believe great software isn't just about clean code—it's about truly understanding the people who will use it and having the perseverance to solve any problem that comes up.
                </p>

                <p class="about-paragraph">
                    When I'm not coding, you'll find me at silent disco, salsa dancing, exploring new restaurants with my wife, or at home spoiling our two cats.
                </p>

                <p class="about-paragraph cta-paragraph">
                    Let's build something great together. Whether you have a clear vision or just the spark of an idea, I'd love to help make it happen.
                </p>
